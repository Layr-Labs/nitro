Fuzzing for brotli. You'll need `cargo-fuzz`. Install it with `cargo install
cargo-fuzz`. You'll also need to use the Rust nightly compiler - `rustup
default nightly`.

Then you can fuzz with
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run compress -- -max_len=262144
```
or
```bash
cargo +nightly fuzz run decompress -- -max_len=262144
```
